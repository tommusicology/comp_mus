## Analysing new high ranking top 2000 songs

The Top 2000 is an annual Dutch marathon radio program, that plays the 2,000 most popular songs of all time determined by a public vote. The highest ranking songs do not vary much from year to year but there sometimes new songs. I am interested in if these new songs are similiar to older high ranking songs compared to other popular songs from the same year.

The new top 2000 songs probably have more focus on instruments compared to other hit songs from the same years.  

As for the corpus i will be using the 2020 edition of the top 2000 and comparing to the spotify Dutch top 50 playlist.


My interpretation is that you want to comb through the Top 2000 and compare the newly added songs to the rest of the list. With the hypothesis that the newly added songs in comparison to the older songs, have more focus on the instrumental aspects. What that means is I guess new songs contain more instrumental melodies and less sung vocals or are they more present? Elaborate.

- I would say the advantage of using the Top 2000 is that you have a large population of songs to choose from, so various comparisons can be made and if will be more significant when an effect is found according to statistics. So your corpus selection is your strongest point. But I can't get my head around why you would compare it to the Dutch top 50 and you didn't elaborate it.
- Your hypothesis is that new songs are more instrumental. But you didn't say why, asin what are you assumptions / observations that make you think this. So, think about the assumptions. Write them down.

I think you can't find pretty interesting things. But some additional thought about your research question is necessary.
